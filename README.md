# scuffedProcessing
**WIP**
This is a c++ header file that has various functions with very self explanatory names. The end file generated is in ppm format. 
This is a work in progress and I will be updating the project in the future with the end goal of implementing all of the processing java's vanilla functions and variables.

"But why? Processing is already pretty great."
Well, I guess it's fun..
